            <p>Holidays are right around the corner. It’s time for people to put their travel plans on the calendars. Whether you’re trying to make that last minute flight for Thanksgiving dinner or planning months in advance for that beach vacation trip, what will prices look like? The goal of this project is to predict the flight price on a particular future date using a machine learning algorithm that will train historical data.</p>
